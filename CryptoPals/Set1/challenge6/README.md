## Challenge
This is where shit gets crazy. This could end up being a seriously long walkthrough and I'm not doing a TLDR;. With our new and improved scoring method, however, we should be able to pull this one off. Our challenge is to take a base64 encoded file, decode it and break the repeating key XOR that encrypted it. This is going to be challenging and I hope that I can help you understand what is going on with this one.

## Problem
First, it says, we have to make a function to compute the Hamming distance between two strings. This is nearly trivial because the Hamming distance is simply the number of bits that differ between the two strings. 

## Solution
