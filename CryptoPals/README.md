# CryptoPals
Solutions to the challenges located at https://cryptopals.com/

## Purpose
The purpose of theses challenges is to further your understanding of cryptography.

## Motivation
In the spirit of my CryptoTools repo, I wish to help others learn about cryptography as I do. There is no point system at CryptoPals so if you copy these scripts and simply use them to break the ciphers, you haven't accomplished anything. However, if you use these to understand the cryptosystems, you are on the right track.

## Challenges
In this section, I will name the challenges that I have completed and the one I am currently working on. If you see that there is something that I am doing poorly or incorrectly, please create an issue and explain it to me. I will give you credit for teaching me the correct way. Also, each challenge will be in its own folder with its own readme.
